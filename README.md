# the-hangman-game

This is a hangman CLI game. This game's secret keeper (computer) makes an API request for the word that will be guessed. This word is then displayed using `_` for each letter in the word. The guesser (user) can guess one letter at a time until they either hit 6 incorrect guesses or have guessed the word correctly. The game also keeps track of the guesser's correctly guessed words and returns it to them once they decide to quit.
